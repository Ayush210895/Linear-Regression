# Linear-Regression

Add regularization term using ||0|| to:
Normal equation (Closed form solution) 
Gradient Descent. 
Ensuring to pass the regularization as a parameter to the class, so we could run our model with regularization term or without regularization term
Add a function to calculate the Stochastic gradient descent.
Be sure to pass the necessary parameters to your class so you could switch between gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.
Add a plotting function that will plot the error costs of the gradient descent.
Be sure to plot the cost of your model during the training steps.
verify your function using test set of all the three datasets and information given in the document. 

reported the RMSE and SSE over the test set for all three datasets.
